# Miguel-s-Custom-Devboard-RP2040
I started this project as a way to practice and learn some more about pcb design. This board is not perfect as it is my second pcb and my first devboard.
    
# Schematic Design
    
I followed the [Custom Devboard Guided Project](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/starter-projects/devboard) by [Kai Pereira](https://github.com/KaiPereira/build-a-devboard) so it was not my design but I did rout the PCB myself and added and LED.
