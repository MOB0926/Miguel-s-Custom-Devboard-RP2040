## 12/29/2025 - Created Schematic  

_Time spent: 3.5h_  

I created a File for my project and added a PCB file inside where I will be housing my KiCad files for the project.

I then began to add my components into my schematic. For this I followed the guide on what I needed and how I connected it all. 

Components: 
- RP2040 (MCU)
- Crystal Oscillator (Clock Basicaly)
- Flash Memory (Memory / Storage)
- I/O Headers
- USB_C (For power and data)

After I added everything I ran an ERC (Electrical Rules Check) to make sure there were no errors I did not notice.

## 12/30/2025 12 AM - Laying out the PCB  

_Time spent: 4.5h_  

Assigned the correct footprints for the components in the schematic footprint editor.

Once the schematic was done I got started on the PCB.

I set the large components in place and most of the capacitors. I then began to rout the high speed connections to get an idea of where to place all other connections.

(I am in PCB hell with these capacitors)

After the highspeed was done I began to connect the capacitors and GPIO pins.

I now must sleep so the rest of the PCB will have to be completed tomorrow.

## 12/30/2025 4 PM - Continued Routing PCB + Added LED  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

Finished routing GPIO and noticed the GPIO 25 was unused, so I added an addressable LED (SK6812 Mini)

After that I contiued with the ground but im out of time so I will finish it later.

## 12/31/2025 - Finished Routing  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

I finaly finished all of the unfinished traces, and I technicaly finished my PCB but it has a lot of DRC errors and warnings.

I think the board is very ineficient since it is my first attemt at such a complicated build, so I am tempted to give the PCB a second run now that I am more experienced.

## 1/3/2026 - V.2 of PCB  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

Well I completetly re-routed the PCB in a V.2 doc to fix all of the errors and ineficiensies without completely erasing my work.

This took much longer than it should have but i have been traveling a lot and made the error of not constantly saving a few times.

I also removed most of the silkscreen as it was getting out of hand

## 1/8/2026 5:04 PM - Prepared for Possible Production  

_Time spent: 5.0h_  

I prepared my design for manufacturing in JLCPCB

This took a long time because it is the first time I do this and once I was almost done I realized the LED I had chosen was unavailable and had to choose another one, which meant going back to the schematic and pcb and completely redoing the prep for manufacturing.

(WOW THIS IS EXPENSIVE) (Definitely going to have to remove some things to solder myself)  

## 1/8/2026 5:18 PM - A.I. strikes again  

_Time spent: 0.1h_  

I removed any part I had any skill to solder myself but I would only really save like max 8 dollars which is definitely less than what it would cost to buy these components myself plus the risk of damaging anything
   
I guess this one will have to wait due to the A.I. ram/memory crisis making my flash memory cost 4x what it should

## 1/8/2026 5:34 PM - It was not A.I.  

_Time spent: 0.1h_  

BOOOOOM Figured it out.
I stuck my two braincells together and realized I had it a Standard PCBA not Economic

Changing it cause a slight problem where it would deny me the ability to use economic due to my led but by changing it to a different version and then deselecting it I have succeded in saving myself 30 dollars

## 1/9/2026 9 PM - Created Repo  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

I uploaded my design files and jurnal to my repo, and created a readme where I added information and pictures of my work and journey through this project.

## 1/9/2026 10 PM - Finalized Repo + Product Shipped  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

I checked the guidelines and am pretty sure my project is ready for submission. I completed my repo and finished my BOM

I have now sent my project in for review (I hope I didn't forget anything dumb)

## 1/14/2026 - Updated BOM  

_Time spent: 0.1h_  

Hehehe I forgot to change to only 2 pcba, I never did because JLCPCB was not allowing me to select it in the cart but after some research I just had to go back to edit the pcb settings so I got that resolved

Also my BOM was a little inaccurate so I updated that to reflect the changes
